The next plan is that I will put the voxel terrain into the game. I have already summarized several very famous survival games and sandbox games like *Don't Starve*, *The Long Dark*, *Super Mario Odyssey*, etc. About game design, I am going to give several character actions to one tool, then design the enemy creature according to these actions. It seems a good perspective to me.

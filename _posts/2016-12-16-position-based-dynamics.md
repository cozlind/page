Position Based Dynamics is an algorithm proposed by Matthias Müller to simulate dynamics system. It's usually used in cloth simulation, elasticity simulation, deform simulation. [The paper](http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf) first proposed in 2006. There is also a research use position based method to simulate fluid.

This is an uncompleted implementation made with unity3d. I have attained a distance constraint and angle constraint but the later one seems has a problem.

The design of character comes from my cup and the scene come from my desk. Players can jump or press the key to trigger some switches and get passed through the obstacles. The goal is to get to the door on the display.

It takes about 1 month to make this, learned a lot about unity's 2d system. The movement of character is sort of weird because I just use rigidbody2d to control the character without freezing rotation. Then in case of falling down, I restricted the angle within a range by code. Although it's not work so well but some feedback says it's cute.

It also the assignment for my software engineer course. I didn't have much time to get into this after deadline. So it actually only have 1 level, and the player guide is very bad.

The shining point I think is the light path under the lamp. You need to turn on the lamp then get a path to get through.

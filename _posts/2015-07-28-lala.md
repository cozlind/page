The gamejam lasts 48 hours. The theme is the hashtag sign #, which we interpreted as the separation of the space by lines and faces. It's an idea of turing the two dimensional space into a three dimension one. The mechanism for the game is simply constructing a route by pulling up the blocks and have the little white sphere to reach to her destination.

We have designed a variety of blocks with totally different properties. The blud water block can only be dragged up. the red bronzed wood block is undraggable. While the wine block will stop the movement of the sphere. White jump block will help the sphere jump more than one block.

After the gamejam, we discussed two times, and decided to add some new blocks like arrow blocks, move blocks, push blocks. Then we can create a more complex level.

From the feedback, the tutorial accomplished through UI tutorials seems not so straightforward and player usually get confused about what to do next.

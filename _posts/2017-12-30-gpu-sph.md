Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for simulating the dynamics of continuum media. It's usually can be used in fluid simulation, multi-phase fluid simulation.

It's first published by Gingold and Monaghan in 1977 for astrophysical problems. Now it have been one of the most famous particle fluid simulation method.

I have read large quatities of documents and books to understand the theory and realize it on compute shader. The final project was developed based on the 2d sph version comes from [4].

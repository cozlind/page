It's a Rime stylized flame vfx demo, and I made this following Simon Schreibt's [tutorial](https://simonschreibt.de/gat/stylized-vfx-in-rime/) with [Shaderforge](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/cn/#!/content/14147).

The basic process is moving the noise texture at different speed, then mask the combination result. After that sectionalize the color to get the stylized look.

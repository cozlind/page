I spent only two weeks to develop this with Notepad++. The idea is from [zhihu.com](www.zhihu.com) and [quora.com](www.quora.com). It's basically a Q&A community with a SQLSever database.

Users can choose the topic square, or propose a new question, or search for a specific question.In the datebase part, I implemented basic insert, delete, update and select function.

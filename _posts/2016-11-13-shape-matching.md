introduction: Shape Matching is a sort of position based algorithm for handling of deformation, which is more efficient than the classic Mass-Spring model. This is an interactive demo.

Shape Matching is a sort of position based algorithm for handling of deformation, which is more efficient than the classic Mass-Spring model. I made this follow the *Computer Graphics JP*.

As the figure shows, the shape can be dragged while finally recover to the cube.

The game jam lasts 48 hours. The theme is 'wave', which we interpreted as the wave of love and the wave to change a terrain. We imagine an island that can be changed by God (Player). And there are humans living this place.

The final goal is to reproduce as more humans as possible and let them defeat the black titan.

The basic mechanism is changing the terrain to make stronger humans meet with each other and produce stronger descendants. By choosing of evolution (God), these stronger children can construct an army to defeat the evil titan.

I made the mechanism that changing the terrain and path finding algorithm on the customized terrain. And I didn't feel very satisfied with the art so I added some Japanese wave pattern textures to the terrain and designed the UI.

The team has two people, the other one called [Dong Mi](https://www.gracg.com/dongmi), is a very talented 2d artist working in animation company. He is very good at the combination of fantasy and modern Chinese cultural elements. And I'm actually his fan. It's his first time to try game creating. We planned only a prototype and experiencing the process of game development. Here is the very first concept art draft.

Implementing this only cost 2 weeks. I was not familiar with flocking algorithm that time.

The Player can build the ship spawn base, defensive satellite, shield, laser satellite, etc. Every ship has three properties: energy, agility, and strength. When player builds enough ships, he can conquer other planets with his ships. The idea is pretty straightforward.

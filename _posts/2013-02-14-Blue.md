It's my first game in life. I learned unity3d, blender, LMMS for one month during the winter holiday, then made this. It's a very simple game and the animation is also rough but it's memorable to me.

The story is about a girl lost in the dream world. She has to hand over the match to the boy to continue the tour. But the truth is the tour will repeat all the time unless player choose to stay without doing anything.

The idea was affected by *Machinarium*, but I did't have much skills in art.

I didn't have game development experience at that time, so I used the 3d model with animation to create a 2d game. And I couldn't handle the jump very well because I coded the jump movement by a two-order function. XD

Monody is a mechanism experiment combining ACT to the music game. The character can move, attack and defend by pressing the key with a beat.

The Player can move by simply pressing the key and rotate the line direction. When attacking, the character will stay in the height, then press the beat to charge. Shield also need energy, so the interaction is basically the same.

For setting the beats for music, I write a unity asset to read the `.wav` file. It's very like the animation panel, and it can record the key I input while audio file playing. Then I can still adjust the key bar position. The output is customized `.txt` file.

It takes me a very long time to adjust the original audio file in Adobe Audition to split the music into several loop clips.

Maybe a waveform identification feature would be more convenient for a music game.

I try to attain a triple-A level game within one week. With the free assets of [Adam](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/cn/#!/content/74969) , [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) and a [3rd person controller asset](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/cn/#!/content/44227). Finally created this soul-like game with a cg animation.

The main menu background comes from Keijiro's [Skinner](https://github.com/keijiro/Skinner) and [KvantSpray](https://github.com/keijiro/KvantSpray). The effect is stunning.

Our team has two people, another one is 3d artist. her job is to rebinding mixamo animation to 3dmax biped so that we can use both mixamo's animations and ones from other assets.

Adam's official assets already have some animations, then I tried to add some subtitles and design the cutscenes to improve the overall atmosphere. Well, at least I think it's not bad.

The enemies controllers and player's character is mainly managed by the 3rd person controller asset. Enemies are divided to two different groups depends on damage and vitality. There are about 30 enemies distributed on this scene.

Player can cleave , guard , roll, or change weapons.  Enemies are able to the same thing, so it's definitely difficulte when a bunch of enemies attracted.

We set a very simple story to give player a query to find himself who he was. The only way is to kill every enemies. If he did it, water will flood meaning the end.

The water is also an [asset](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/cn/#!/content/33434) which is perfect match this environment.

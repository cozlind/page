During my internship in ZK3D, Inc, I developed MDN Intelligent Decoration with my colleagues in two months.  Our team has 6 people, including me 2 programmers, 3 3d artists and one UI artist.

As the lead programmer, I developed most part of this software, specifically, everything except server connection and asset download. And I also bore some UI works.

The very first version is for Android, which cost us about two months. For creating a hole in customized wall mesh, I tried many different ways and finally, I constructed the wall with mesh nodes. Everytime user want to put a door in any position on the wall, maybe beyond the edge of a wall, it works well.

After that, we move forward to develop the desktop version. The basic program is the same, but I improve it with a floor customize function. It needs to create a polygon, maybe a concave polygon, with some clicks. At the same time, every point including wall point can be moved and stick to neighbor points.

The VR part is very easy to implement, I think. I create a local network server with VR camera. When users save their layouts on android pad or desktop, it can be seen immediately with Oculus.

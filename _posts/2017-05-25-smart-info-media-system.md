It's a course assignment of *Smart Info-Media System*.

## Fractal

The fractal is an abstract object used to describe and simulate naturally occurring objects. Artificially created fractals commonly exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales. *Mandelbrot set* is a typical example for self-similarity that nearly the same at different levels.

Another example of the fractal is called *Reaction-diffusion system*, which corresponds to several physical phenomena: the change of chemical substances in space and time.

## Chaos

Chaos theory focused on the behaviors of a dynamical system that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Butterfly effect and bifurcation diagram are typical chaos system.

## Cellular Automaton

The cellular automaton is also called life game, consisting of a grid of cells. Each cell has their own states, and they are changing continuously according to their neighborhoods. The initial state and initial rule are all able to affect the final result. The results can be classified as homogeneous, oscillating, chaotic and interim.

I set the random inital parameters and colors to make this one.

## Percolation

Percolation theory describes the behaviors of connected clusters in a random graph. It can be used to simulate a spreading fire in forest.

Besides above all, this course also introduced complex networks, multi-agnets system, which is more abstract so I didn't upload the picture.

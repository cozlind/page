I try to realize a basic collection and crafting mechanism of survival game . With a series of lowpoly assets in asset store, maximo and the 3rd person controller coded by myself. 

It's still under development.

The 3rd person controller is coded with the reference of [Sharp Accent's Souls-like Series Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m9tDF2v-5Q), which is very helpful, having answered a lot of question about character animation, trivial details in development.

The character can use two tools for now : ax and shovel, which is related to two different materials. Then crafting system can transform the materials into new tools.

The next plan is that I will put the voxel terrain into the game. I have already summarized several very famous survival games and sandbox games like *Don't Starve*, *The Long Dark*, *Super Mario Odyssey*, etc. About game design, I am going to give several character actions to one tool, then design the enemy creature according to these actions. It seems a good perspective to me.

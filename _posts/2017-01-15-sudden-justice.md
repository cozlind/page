Sudden Justice is a drone game prototype. Player can control the drone reconnoitre over the city and launch missiles.

The basic idea is to make a drone simulator to test the visual effect and flight controling. And the final result is fine.

Taking the real drone system as reference, I make the UI. And the drone control and camera control are separated. The post effect comes from [camera filter pack](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/cn/#!/content/18433).
